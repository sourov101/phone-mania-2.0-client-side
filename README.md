1. I have used react, firebase, stripe to build this application <br/>
2. users can sign up as buyers/users or sellers<br/>
3. if the user is signed up as buyers he/she can book items and buy them<br/>
4. if the user is a seller he/she can buy items from other seller, add product to sell and advertise or delete, see his own products in seller dashboard<br/>
5. admin can delete anu user(seller,buyer), verify seller, or make other users admin in admin panel<br/>
